# 🚀 Codeforces Solutions
this repository contains all the solutions I attempted along with solutions for contests. The language I use is C++ and I am a beginner in it

---

## 🎯 My Aim 
- I will try to be consistent with ideally 10 problems a day 
- Get better at coding and solving problems in general

---

- Problems are organized by ratings i.e(800,900,1000, etc) I will add them later as I progress
